    "staff": "**Welcome – Jeffrey Staff Guide**\n\nThis channel is auto‑maintained by Jeffrey and pinned for quick reference.\n\n**Setup & Admin**\n• /setup – Re‑run channel setup (docs, queues, pins).\n• /language scope: Server – Change the bot’s server language for shared content.\n• Permissions: Jeffrey needs Manage Channels/Roles, Manage Messages, Threads, and basic message perms. If something looks off, a health‑check message will include a ‘Fix Permissions’ link and ‘Run setup again’ button.\n\n**Queues (FREE)**\n• Staff panel: #staff-queues → select queue, Shuffle/Clear, Blacklist users, Edit queue.\n• Student panel: #student-queues → students pick a queue and Join/Leave.\n• Blacklist prevents joins and removes listed users from queues.\n\n**Events (FREE)**\n• /createevent – Opens a modal to create an event visible via /viewevents.\n• /viewevents – Shows upcoming events (ephemeral).\n\n**AI Features (PREMIUM 🔒)**\n• Code Review: Reply to code blocks with Yes/No. ‘Yes’ DMs (or threads) a review.\n• Q&A Assistant: Ask a question ending with ‘?’ → choose Yes/No for private help or a thread.\n• History Search: DM Jeffrey natural‑language questions (e.g., ‘who asked about arrays?’, ‘what was discussed last Friday?’).\n\nNotes: Premium is per user or per server via Discord App Directory. When entitlement is missing Jeffrey replies with a ‘Premium required’ card.\n\n**Guidelines**\n• Keep discussions professional; avoid sensitive personal data in chats.\n• Be transparent when a response is AI‑generated.\n• Respect channel topics and thread context to keep history useful.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n• Missing channels or pins → run /setup (Manage Server).\n• Missing permissions → use the ‘Fix Permissions’ button then ‘Run setup again’.\n• Commands not visible → wait a few seconds after invite; Jeffrey also registers per‑guild automatically.",
